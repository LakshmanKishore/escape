A singleplayer game. This game cannot be played in laptop. Please play it in Mobile.

## Lessons Learned

I learnt more about HTML5 Canvas and some Object Oeriented Concepts from Javascript.
Since Javascript doesn't have touch and hold eventListener,
So I learnt and created own touch and hold eventListener using `touchstart` and `touchend` eventListener.
